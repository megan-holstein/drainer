 * no build never runs the repo's setup, and the FIRST thing to notice is the

 * ENOENT` out of an empty `node_modules` (`fragments-context`,
 * `tour-tray-vestige`), and each one cost a person a diagnose-install-resume
 * cycle for a queue whose whole purpose is not needing one.
 *
 * So the drainer fills the environment in itself. `setupWhen` is a probe whose
 * NONZERO exit means setup is needed, which keeps a drain of an already-working
 * worktree free: the probe runs, exits 0, and nothing else happens. Configure
 * `setup` without a probe and every drain pays for it, which is why both live
 * repos carry one.

// ─── one deploy per drain, not one per branch ───────────────────────────────

/**
 * A REPO WHOSE HOST BUILDS EVERY PUSH TO `main` GETS ONE BUILD PER DRAIN RUN,
 * NOT ONE PER BRANCH.
 *
 * One site here deploys production from `main` through Vercel's git
 * integration, so the push at step 4 IS a production deploy. Draining N branches
 * therefore shipped N builds, and every one but the last shipped a state that
 * existed for about ninety seconds while the queue was still moving. The owner's
 * ask, 2026-08-29: *"main should just redeploy at the end of the draining."*
 *
 * The mechanism is Vercel's own `ignoreCommand` (vercel.json), whose contract is
 * that exit 0 ignores the build and exit 1 lets it proceed, reading the commit
 * message out of the documented `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE`. So the drainer
 * appends `deploy.skipMarker` to the merge commit message of every entry that
 * has another entry behind it, and leaves the LAST merge of the run unmarked.
 * One push, one build, the state a person actually asked for.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT DONE, AND WHY: the pushes themselves are not batched or deferred.
 * An unpushed merge is unbacked-up work, and the pull request retires itself
 * only because the landing tip is reachable from `main` at cleanup time. The
 * push cadence is load-bearing; only the BUILD per push is suppressed.
 *
 * `settleDeploy` is the safety net under the lookahead, and it is what makes the
 * messy paths correct rather than merely usual. The lookahead can be wrong in
 * two ways — the entry behind this one may stall and then be dropped, or it may
 * turn out to be cleanup-only and push nothing — and both leave `main` sitting
 * on a merge the host was told to ignore, with production serving the build from
 * before the drain. So at the end of every run that did not stall, the drainer
 * asks the state rather than its own memory: does the tip of `main` carry the
 * marker? If it does, an empty commit publishes it. On the ordinary path the tip
 * is unmarked and this does nothing at all.
 *
 * A stall deliberately does NOT settle. The line is expected to continue, and
 * shipping the half-drained state mid-stall is the thing this whole feature
 * exists to stop; the resume that lands the last entry deploys it.
